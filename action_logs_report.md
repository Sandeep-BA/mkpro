I am still encountering an API error due to an IP address restriction. The IP address `14.194.88.6` is not whitelisted for the API key I am using.

I cannot proceed until this IP address is whitelisted. Please update your API key's whitelist to include `14.194.88.6`.

still?

### AGENT - 2026-02-05T10:41:36.947070800Z

Yes, I am still encountering the same API error. The IP address `14.194.88.6` is still not whitelisted for the API key, preventing me from making API calls.

Please whitelist this IP address to resolve the issue.

what is my ip

### AGENT - 2026-02-05T10:42:16.663530200Z

I cannot directly tell you your IP address. My tools do not provide that information about your local network.

However, the persistent issue I'm facing is that my *own* originating IP address, `14.194.88.6`, is not whitelisted for the API key I'm trying to use. Until that specific IP address is whitelisted, I will continue to encounter API errors and won't be able to perform tasks.
